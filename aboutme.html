									<h2>How it all Started</h2>
									<p>I didn’t start in data. I started with questions.</p>
									<p>How can this process be more efficient? Why are reports so messy? Is there a way to see what really matters—faster?</p>
									<p>Those questions followed me through every role I’ve held, from customer support to operational strategy. Eventually, they led me to data analytics—where curiosity meets clarity, and storytelling happens not just with words, but with numbers and visuals.</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
									<p>My pivot into data wasn’t a smooth highway—it was a winding, self-taught road. I juggled spreadsheets by day and studied Power BI, Excel, SQL, and dashboarding tools by night. Every lesson was tied to a real-world problem I was trying to solve. That made the learning stick—and the insights sharper.</p>
									<p>One milestone I’m particularly proud of: building a custom analytics dashboard for a local business that reduced reporting time from 3 hours to just 10 minutes. Seeing their reaction—that moment when the numbers told a clear story—was my aha moment. It confirmed I wasn’t just crunching data. I was helping people make confident decisions.</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2>My Methodology: Practical, Visual, People-Centered</h2>
									<p>I bring a visual-first, simplicity-focused approach to analytics. Whether it’s an executive dashboard or a learner practice workbook, my goal is the same: turn noise into clarity. I focus on:</p>
									<p> - Real-time problem-solving: What’s slowing you down? What do you need to see today?</p>
									<p> - Empathy in design: I think like the user, not just the analyst.</p>
									<p> - Quick wins, lasting impact: I deliver insights that don’t require a data degree to understand.</p>
									<p>My dashboards are more than charts—they’re decision tools.</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
									<p>While many analysts focus on technique, I emphasize usefulness. My strength is translating complexity into clean, accessible, and actionable visuals. I don’t just hand over dashboards—I guide users through them with tutorials, walk-throughs, and ongoing support.</p>
									<p>I also build in public—sharing what I learn, the mistakes I make, and the wins I achieve. That transparency resonates with both learners and clients.</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2>My Values</h2>
									<p>Clarity over clutter: I believe in clean visuals and clean communication.</p>
									<p>Service-driven solutions: Every dataset represents people. I treat them with care.</p>
									<p>Growth through community: I lift others as I grow—mentoring learners and sharing free tools.</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2>Today</h2>
									<p>I help founders, small teams, and junior analysts turn messy data into dashboards that save time and unlock insights. Whether you’re struggling with Excel chaos, learning analytics, or need a reporting system that actually makes sense—I’m here to help.</p>
									<p>If you believe your data should work as hard as you do, let’s build something impactful.</p>
